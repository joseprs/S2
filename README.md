SCAV Seminar 2

## Exercise 1
Running the function, we can save the video with the motion vectors for each macroblock. In the command, we can decide which group of motion vectors to use: pf, for forward predicted motion vectors of P pictures bf, for forward predicted motion vectors of B pictures and bb, for backward predicted motion vectors of B pictures. We are using all of that.

## Exercise 2
The methodology used to this excercise is the following:
1. Command that cuts the video into 1min video .mp4.
2. Command that takes off the audio to the 1min video.
3. Command that saves the 1min audio into mp3 format.
4. Command that saves the 1min audio into aac format.
5. Merge points 2, 3, 4.
The results and exports of every step are into the "container" folder.
